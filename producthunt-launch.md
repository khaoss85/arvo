### FIRST COMMENT (The Most Important Part)

**This appears immediately below your product. 70% of Product of the Day winners post first comment within 10 minutes of launching.**

```markdown
👋 Hi Product Hunt! I'm [Your Name], creator of ARVO.

**Why I Built This**

I've been lifting for 10+ years, tracking every workout in Excel—formulas for progressive overload, macros for volume calculations, the works. It was effective until I realized: Excel can't tell when I'm tired. It can't suggest "drop 5kg on this set because you left too much in the tank on the last one."

Personal trainers CAN do this, but at $150/session, that's $600-900/month. Not sustainable.

After 6 months of building, ARVO is my answer: an AI coach that gives you real-time, set-by-set guidance—explaining the "why" behind every suggestion so you actually understand your training.

**What ARVO Does**

🏋️ **Real-Time Coaching**: After each set, AI suggests your next weight/reps based on performance
🧠 **Explains Reasoning**: "You left 3 RIR when target was 1—increase 5kg"
⚡ **Adapts Instantly**: Bad day? AI reduces volume. Crushing it? AI pushes you harder
📊 **Methodology Fidelity**: Interprets proven training systems (Kuba Method, Mentzer HIT) with 362+ lines of parametric rules
🎯 **Built for Serious Lifters**: Not generic programs—respects your training approach

**Who It's For**

If you track workouts (even in Excel), follow a methodology, and want intelligent progression without paying $600+/mo for a PT—ARVO is for you.

**🎁 Exclusive Product Hunt Offer**

Get **30% off your first year** with code **HUNTER30** (valid 48 hours).
That's $10.50/mo instead of $15/mo—less than one coffee per week for AI coaching.

**Question for the Community**

What's your biggest frustration with workout apps right now? I'm actively iterating based on feedback, so I'd genuinely love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks for checking out ARVO! Happy to answer any questions. 💪

### ALTERNATIVE FIRST COMMENT (Shorter Version)

**If you want something more concise:**

```markdown
👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Name], solo founder behind ARVO.

**The Problem**: I loved tracking workouts in Excel, but it couldn't adapt when I was tired. Personal trainers could, but $150/session isn't sustainable.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time progression suggestions (< 2s response time)

- Adapts when you're having a bad (or great) day
- Follows proven methodologies (not generic AI nonsense)

**Built For**: Serious lifters who track workouts and want intelligent progression without the $600+/mo PT cost.

**🎁 Product Hunt Exclusive**: 30% off first year with code HUNTER30 (48 hours only).

**Question**: What's your #1 frustration with current workout apps?

Happy to answer any questions! 💪
```

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use the longer first comment
- PH community appreciates depth and authenticity
- Personal story resonates more
- You have the time to write it properly

Voiceover: "I tracked workouts in Excel for 10 years. Now I have an AI coach that does this..."

```

**[7-15s] PROBLEM**
```
Visual: Person looking confused at generic workout app
Text Overlay: "Generic apps: Do 3x10" → "Personal trainers: $150/session"

```
Visual: Real person using ARVO during workout

Scene 1 (10s):

- Log: 100kg x 8 reps, 3 RIR
- ARVO instantly suggests: "Next set: 105kg x 10 reps"
- Shows reasoning: "You left 3 RIR when target was 1..."

Scene 2 (10s):
- Next set: 105kg x 6 reps, 4 RIR (underperformance)
- ARVO adapts: "Reduce to 100kg for remaining sets"
- Shows reasoning: "Significant underperformance suggests fatigue..."

Scene 3 (5s):
- Show parametric knowledge engine (quick visual)

```

### VIDEO PRODUCTION TIPS

**Tool Recommendations** (pick based on resources):
1. **Loom** (easiest): Screen record + webcam narration
2. **iPhone**: Have someone film you using the app in real workout
3. **Screen Recording**: iOS built-in screen record + iMovie for editing

**DON'T NEED**:
- Professional videographer
- Fancy animations
- Perfect lighting/audio

**DO NEED**:
- Clear demonstration of core value (real-time suggestions)
- Authentic feel (PH community prefers real over polished)
- First 7 seconds that hook attention

**TIMELINE**: Spend max 4 hours creating this. Authenticity > perfection.

**Who**: LinkedIn connections, Twitter followers, relevant communities

**LinkedIn Post**:
```
🚀 After 6 months of building in the gym (literally), ARVO is live on Product Hunt!

I started tracking workouts in Excel 10 years ago. Loved the control, hated that it couldn't adapt when I was tired.

Personal trainers could, but $150/session? $600-900/month isn't sustainable for most people.

So I built ARVO: an AI workout coach that gives you real-time, set-by-set guidance. It explains WHY behind every suggestion, adapts when you need it, and costs $15/mo.

Built for serious lifters who want intelligent progression without the PT price tag.

Would love your thoughts: [PH link]

Special offer for my network: Code HUNTER30 = 30% off (48 hours)

**Twitter Thread**:
```
1/ 🚀 ARVO is live on Product Hunt!

An AI workout coach that gives you real-time, set-by-set guidance.

Like a personal trainer in your pocket. $15/mo vs $150/session.

Check it out: [PH link]

Thread: Why I built this 👇

2/ I tracked workouts in Excel for 10 years.

Formulas for progressive overload.
Macros for volume calculations.
Conditional formatting for PRs.

It worked... until it didn't.

3/ Excel can't tell when you're tired.

It can't suggest "drop 5kg because you left too much in the tank."

It can't adapt your workout on the fly.

4/ Personal trainers CAN do this.

But at $150/session, that's $600-900/month.

Not sustainable for most serious lifters.

5/ So I built ARVO.

After each set, AI suggests your next weight/reps based on performance.

"You left 3 RIR when target was 1—increase 5kg"

Real-time adaptation. Real explanations.

6/ Built for serious lifters who:
- Track workouts (even in Excel/notes)
- Follow a methodology
- Want intelligent progression
- Can't afford/don't want a PT at $600+/mo

7/ Live on Product Hunt today: [link]

Special offer: Code HUNTER30 = 30% off (48 hours)

Would love your feedback—be honest! 🙏

8/ Huge thanks to everyone who supported this journey.

Beta testers, friends who listened to me rant about AI latency, everyone who believed.

This is just the beginning. 💪
```

**Reddit** (ONLY if genuinely relevant):
- Post in r/homegym or r/fitness ONLY if providing value
- Frame as "I built this, would love feedback" not "check out my product"
- Be prepared for criticism—Reddit is harsh
- Respond thoughtfully to all comments

**Why Wave 4 Matters**: Peak Product Hunt traffic. Maximum visibility.

No pressure at all, but if you know anyone in fitness/AI who might dig this, a share would be amazing.

Either way, thank you for supporting 🙏
```

**Why Wave 6 Matters**: Last chance to mobilize supporters. Evening is when many check PH.

## 💬 RESPONDING TO COMMENTS (All Day)

### Response Templates

**Genuine Positive Comment**:
```
Thanks so much, [Name]! Really appreciate you checking out ARVO.

[Specific response to what they said]

Are you currently using any workout app, or more of a spreadsheet person?

Always curious to learn how people approach tracking!
```

**Question About Features**:
```
Great question, [Name]!

[Answer the question thoroughly]

[Add context or example]

Is this something you'd find useful? I'm actively prioritizing features based on feedback.
```

**Constructive Criticism**:
```
Really appreciate the honest feedback, [Name].

You're absolutely right about [acknowledge their point].

[Explain your thinking or plans to address it]

This is exactly the kind of input I need—thank you for taking the time!
```

**Comparison to Competitor**:
```
Good question! Here's how ARVO differs from [Competitor]:

1. [Key differentiator 1]
2. [Key differentiator 2]
3. [Key differentiator 3]

That said, [Competitor] does [something] really well. Different approaches for different users.

What's most important to you in a workout app?
```

**Pricing Question**:
```
Fair question about pricing!

Here's my thinking: Personal trainers charge $150/session ($600-900/mo for regular coaching). Generic apps are $10-20/mo but don't adapt.

ARVO is $15/mo—positioned between generic and personalized. The AI adapts to YOUR performance in real-time, which is what you're paying for.

Does that value equation make sense? Always open to feedback on pricing!
```

**"Another AI App" Skepticism**:
```
Totally get the skepticism—lots of GPT wrappers out there calling themselves "AI fitness apps."

What makes ARVO different:
1. Real-time adaptation (after each set, not just at workout start)
2. Parametric knowledge engine (362 lines of methodology rules, not generic prompts)
3. Explains reasoning (transparency builds trust)
4. <2s response time (critical for mid-workout use)

I built this because I was frustrated with the generic AI apps too!

Would love to hear what you think after trying it (code HUNTER30 for 30% off).
```

**Technical Question** (from developer):
```
Great question!

[Technical answer—this is Product Hunt, devs are here]

I actually wrote about the architecture on dev.to if you want to nerd out: [link to dev.to article]

Are you building anything in the AI space?
```

**How to Handle Trolls/Negativity**:
- Respond once, politely and professionally
- Don't engage in arguments
- If it's truly abusive, report and move on
- Your grace under criticism is visible to the community

**Golden Rule**: Respond to EVERY comment within 1-2 hours if possible. Fast responses = engagement = algorithmic boost.

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS (What to Track)

### Product Hunt Metrics
- **Upvotes**: Aim for 200-400 (realistic for first launch)
- **Comments**: Aim for 50-100 (comments = 10x value of upvotes)
- **Ranking**: Top 5 = Featured, Top 3 = excellent, #1 = outstanding
- **Featured Status**: Getting on Featured tab is success (manual curation)

### Business Metrics (Your Goal: User Acquisition)
- **Signups**: Track how many from PH traffic
- **Trial Starts**: % of signups who start a workout
- **Completion**: % who finish their first workout
- **Conversion**: % who redeem HUNTER30 code
- **Email Capture**: Build list for future marketing

### Conversion Funnel
```
PH Traffic → Landing Page → Signup → Trial Start → First Workout → Code Redemption → Paid User
```

Track drop-off at each stage. Optimize biggest bottleneck.

---

## 🎯 CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION (User Acquisition Focus)

Since your goal is acquiring early users, not just getting upvotes:

- [ ] Trust signals (beta user testimonials if available)
- [ ] Simple signup flow (email + password, no friction)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized (50%+ of PH traffic is mobile)
- [ ] Fast load time (<3s)

### Signup Flow Optimization
- [ ] One-step signup (email/password only initially)
- [ ] Clear value reminder ("Start your first AI-coached workout")
- [ ] Onboarding in <2 minutes (don't lose them)
- [ ] Immediate value (let them start a workout RIGHT AWAY)
- [ ] Capture email before requiring payment

### Special Offer Strategy
- **Code**: HUNTER30
- **Discount**: 30% off first year
- **Time Limit**: 48 hours from launch
- **Visibility**: Mentioned in first comment, landing page banner, email
- **Goal**: Create urgency without being sleazy

### Follow-Up Email Sequence (For Non-Converters)

No pressure—just always looking to improve!

[Your Name]

Either way, thanks for being part of the launch!

[Your Name]
```

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Pre-Launch Mistakes
1. ❌ **Launching with bugs**: Test EVERYTHING. One bad user experience = lost forever.
2. ❌ **No email list**: You need 400+ supporters. Can't build from zero on launch day.
3. ❌ **Wrong timing**: Launching Tuesday when OpenAI drops GPT-6 = death.
4. ❌ **Untested landing page**: Conversion optimization BEFORE launch, not after.

### Launch Day Mistakes
5. ❌ **Blasting everyone at once**: Stagger waves. Maintain momentum over 24 hours.
6. ❌ **Slow responses**: Every hour you don't respond = lost engagement.
7. ❌ **Being too salesy**: "Check out my product!" ≠ "I'd love your honest feedback"
8. ❌ **Ignoring criticism**: Trolls aside, most criticism is valuable. Acknowledge it.

### Post-Launch Mistakes
9. ❌ **Disappearing**: Stay active on PH for a week. Respond to late comments.

- Product Hunt is ONE launch channel, not your entire strategy
- Authenticity > perfection
- Engagement > upvotes (comments matter more)
- User acquisition > vanity metrics
- This is a marathon, not a sprint

**Your advantages**:
- Real-time AI form correction is genuinely innovative
- Personal story resonates (10 years of Excel!)
- Clear value prop ($15/mo vs $150/session)
- You're solving a real problem you've experienced

**Final thought**:
The Product Hunt community is incredibly supportive of indie makers. Be authentic, be helpful, be present—and you'll do great.

Now go build those assets and prepare to launch! 💪
