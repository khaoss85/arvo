# Arvo

> AI-powered parametric workout tracker with 15 specialized AI agents. Real-time set-by-set coaching using GPT-5 reasoning models. Implements complete training methodologies with scientific fidelity including Kuba Method, Mike Mentzer HIT, FST-7, Y3T, and Mountain Dog Training.

Arvo is a smart workout tracking application built for three distinct user types:

1. **Competitive Athletes & IFBB PRO Bodybuilders** - Advanced methodology-aware coaching with context-aware volume tracking (MEV/MAV/MRV), set-by-set guidance, and cycle-to-cycle learning
2. **Tech-Savvy Fitness Enthusiasts** - Full transparency into AI reasoning, biomechanical decisions, and training science
3. **Casual Gym-Goers & Beginners** - Simplified interface with automatic progression and zero decision-making required

## Key Features

- **15 Specialized AI Agents**: Exercise Architect, Load Navigator, real-time adaptation engines
- **1300+ Exercise Database**: Complete biomechanical categorization with video demonstrations
- **5 Training Methodologies**: Complete implementations (not interpretations) of proven systems
- **Real-time Set-by-Set Coaching**: Weight recommendations, rest timers, RPE/RIR tracking
- **Notes Intelligence**: AI-powered insights from workout notes and historical patterns
- **Equipment Vision**: Smart exercise substitutions based on available equipment
- **Privacy-First Design**: Passwordless authentication, no credit card required

## Training Methodologies

Arvo implements complete training methodologies as knowledge bases, not simplified interpretations:

- **Kuba Method**: Evidence-based parametric training with 2 working sets @ RIR 0-1, tempo 3-1-1-1, 60% lengthened-biased exercises, 6-week periodization cycles
- **Mike Mentzer HIT**: High-intensity training philosophy with 1-2 sets to absolute failure, 4-7 day recovery, pre-exhaust techniques
- **FST-7 (Hany Rambod)**: Fascia Stretch Training with 7 consecutive sets, 30-45s rest, absolute failure, critical hydration protocols
- **Y3T (Neil Hill)**: Undulating periodization across 3-week microcycles (heavy/hybrid/hell weeks)
- **Mountain Dog Training (John Meadows)**: 4-phase workout structure with accommodating resistance, loaded stretching, no programmed deloads

## Core AI Agents

Arvo uses 15 specialized AI agents that work together:

1. **Exercise Architect**: Designs workouts using GPT-5 reasoning, considers 8+ variables including weak points, equipment availability, injury warnings, and methodology rules
2. **Load Navigator**: Real-time weight recommendations based on previous set performance, RIR/RPE, mental readiness, and periodization phase
3. **Volume Tracker**: Monitors weekly volume relative to MEV/MAV/MRV landmarks per muscle group
4. **Rest Timer Intelligence**: Adaptive rest periods based on exercise type, methodology, and performance
5. **Notes Intelligence**: Extracts insights from free-form workout notes using NLP
6. **Equipment Substitution Engine**: Biomechanically equivalent exercise swaps based on available equipment
7. **Injury Prevention Monitor**: Tracks joint stress patterns and suggests modifications
8. **Progressive Overload Calculator**: Ensures systematic progression across training cycles
9. **Hydration Reminder**: Context-aware hydration cues (critical for FST-7)
10. **Audio Coaching System**: Set-by-set audio guidance during workouts
11. **Performance Pattern Detector**: Identifies trends and plateaus across training history
12. **Tempo & Technique Coach**: Provides tempo recommendations and technical cues per exercise
13. **Deload Optimizer**: Suggests deload timing based on accumulated fatigue
14. **Exercise Selection Diversifier**: Rotates exercises to prevent adaptation
15. **Warm-up Architect**: Generates dynamic warm-ups based on main workout content

## Target Use Cases

- **Competitive Bodybuilding Prep**: Full methodology implementations for serious athletes
- **Strength Training & Progressive Overload**: Systematic weight progression with AI guidance
- **Gym Programming**: Complete workout generation with AI-selected exercises
- **Training Cycle Management**: 6-12 week mesocycles with automatic periodization
- **Exercise Substitution**: Real-time swaps based on equipment availability or injury
- **Performance Analytics**: Historical tracking and pattern detection
- **Beginner Onboarding**: 5-minute setup with zero training knowledge required
