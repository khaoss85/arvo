# Product Hunt Ship - Pre-Launch Thread Strategy for ARVO

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

**Timeline**: Post these threads 2-4 weeks before official Product Hunt launch
**Goal**: Build waitlist, validate features, create anticipation, establish credibility
**Frequency**: 1 thread per week (don't spam)
**Tone**: Helpful maker, not salesperson

---

## 📌 THREAD #1: Problem Validation (Week -4)
**Best Timing**: 3-4 weeks before launch
**Goal**: Validate problem, gather insights, soft intro ARVO
**Expected Engagement**: 15-30 comments

### TITLE (Hook Question)
```
Serious lifters: Do you track workouts in Excel/Notes? What's the biggest pain point?
```

### BODY
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt community! 👋

Quick question for anyone who lifts seriously and tracks their workouts:

**Do you use Excel, Google Sheets, or note apps to track your training?**

I've been doing this for 10+ years (yes, really). Formulas for progressive overload, conditional formatting for PRs, macros for volume calculations. It works... until it doesn't.

My biggest frustrations:
- ❌ Can't adapt in real-time (if I'm tired, Excel doesn't care)
- ❌ No intelligent suggestions (I have to calculate everything manually)
- ❌ Generic workout apps are too simple (don't respect training methodologies)

**For those who track workouts digitally:**
1. What's your current setup? (Excel, app, pen & paper?)
2. What works well about it?
3. What makes you want to throw your phone across the gym?

I'm building something to solve this for myself (AI coach that adapts set-by-set), but genuinely curious what pain points resonate with others.

Drop your thoughts below! 💪
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
✅ **Question-first**: Not pitching, genuinely asking
✅ **Relatable**: 10 years of Excel is a story people connect with
✅ **Specific**: "Set-by-set adaptation" plants seed without hard sell
✅ **Community value**: Even non-ARVO users benefit from discussion

### FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
- Respond to EVERY comment within 2 hours
- Share your own Excel horror stories
- When people ask "what are you building?", soft intro ARVO with waitlist link
- Don't pitch in original post—let curiosity build

---

## 📌 THREAD #2: Building in Public Update (Week -3)
**Best Timing**: 2-3 weeks before launch
**Goal**: Show progress, tease product, collect feature feedback
**Expected Engagement**: 20-40 comments

### TITLE (Progress Hook)
```
Building an AI workout coach: 6 months in, here's what surprised me most
```

### BODY
```markdown
Hey PH! Quick update on the AI fitness coach I mentioned last week.

**Context**: I'm building ARVO—an AI that coaches you set-by-set during workouts (like a personal trainer, but $15/mo vs $150/session).

**What Surprised Me Most** (building this solo for 6 months):

1️⃣ **AI latency almost killed the product**
Early on, users waited 5-10 seconds between sets for suggestions. That's FOREVER mid-workout. Had to switch to OpenAI's Responses API with reasoning levels—now it's <2s. Night and day difference.

2️⃣ **Users don't care about features—they care about "why"**
I thought people would love "17 AI agents!" Nope. They want: "Why should I do 105kg instead of 100kg?" Transparency > tech flex.

3️⃣ **Distribution is 10x harder than building**
I can ship features daily. Getting people to actually try it? That's the real challenge.

**Screenshot attached**: [Add screenshot of AI suggestion with reasoning]

**Question for makers here:**
What's been your biggest "oh shit" moment building your product? The thing you had to completely rethink?

Also: ARVO beta launching on PH in ~2 weeks. If you're a lifter who tracks workouts, I'd love your feedback. DM me for early access.

Building in public is terrifying but worth it. 🙏
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
✅ **Vulnerable**: Sharing real struggles (latency issue, distribution challenges)
✅ **Specific learnings**: Other makers benefit even if they don't care about fitness
✅ **Visual**: Screenshot makes it real, not vaporware
✅ **Reciprocal question**: "What's your oh shit moment?" generates engagement
✅ **Soft CTA**: "DM for early access" not aggressive

### FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
- Share specific metrics if people ask (completion rates, beta user feedback)
- Offer to do 1-on-1 calls with seriously interested people
- When makers share their "oh shit" moments, genuinely engage and help
- Post screenshot that shows AI reasoning (builds credibility)

---

## 📌 THREAD #3: Beta Announcement (Week -2)
**Best Timing**: 1-2 weeks before launch
**Goal**: Build waitlist, create FOMO, generate signups
**Expected Engagement**: 30-60 comments + signups

### TITLE (FOMO Hook)
```
Opening ARVO beta this week: Lifetime free access for first 100 users
```

### BODY
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 🚀

After 6 months of solo building, ARVO is ready for beta testing.

**What is ARVO?**
An AI workout coach that gives you real-time, set-by-set guidance. Think: personal trainer in your pocket, but free for beta users (vs $150/session for real PT).

**How it works:**
1. You finish a set (e.g., bench press: 100kg x 8 reps)
2. Log your RIR (Reps in Reserve: could've done 3 more)
3. AI instantly suggests next set: "105kg x 10 reps - you left 3 RIR, target is 1"
4. Explains WHY so you understand your training

**Beta Launch Details:**
- 🎁 **Lifetime free access** for first 100 beta users
- 📅 Opening signups this Thursday
- 🎯 Looking for: Serious lifters who track workouts (Excel users, I see you 👀)
- 💪 All features unlocked, no limitations

**Why waitlist?**
I want to personally onboard each user. This isn't a mass launch—it's building a community of people who care about intelligent training.

**Screenshot**: [Add screenshot of workout view with AI suggestion]

**To join the waitlist:**
Drop a comment with:
1. How you currently track workouts
2. What you'd want from an AI coach

Or just comment "interested" and I'll DM you the link!

Launching on Product Hunt in ~1-2 weeks. Would love your support when the time comes. 🙏

Questions? Ask away!
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
✅ **Clear value prop**: Free lifetime access (no brainer)
✅ **Scarcity (but real)**: First 100 users creates urgency
✅ **Specific ask**: "Drop comment with X" generates engagement
✅ **Low friction**: Can just comment "interested"
✅ **Pre-launch hype**: "Launching in 1-2 weeks" primes for actual launch
✅ **Community framing**: "Building a community" not "getting users"

### FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
- DM everyone who comments within 1 hour
- Send personalized messages (reference their tracking method)
- Offer immediate access to highly engaged people
- Create FOMO by updating: "50/100 spots filled" etc.
- Thank everyone publicly for interest

---

## 📌 THREAD #4: "Ask Me Anything" (Week -1)
**Best Timing**: 1 week before launch
**Goal**: Establish expertise, build trust, soft sell ARVO
**Expected Engagement**: 25-50 comments

### TITLE (Expert Positioning)
```
I spent 6 months building AI + fitness app (17 agents, <2s latency). AMA about AI, training, or building solo
```

### BODY
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Launching ARVO (AI workout coach) next week on PH. Thought I'd do a quick AMA while I finish prep.

**Background:**
- 10+ years tracking workouts (Excel → AI)
- 6 months building ARVO solo (developer, first product)
- Built 17 specialized AI agents using OpenAI Responses API
- 30 beta users, 70-80% workout completion rate

**Things I learned the hard way:**
- AI latency optimization (5-10s → <2s response time)
- Multi-agent orchestration with different reasoning levels
- Why users hate features but love outcomes
- Distribution as a solo founder with zero marketing budget
- Building in fitness + AI (very crowded space)

**Happy to answer questions about:**
- ✅ AI/LLM implementation (GPT-5, Responses API, reasoning levels)
- ✅ Training methodology (evidence-based, progressive overload, periodization)
- ✅ Solo founder struggles (motivation, distribution, pricing)
- ✅ Product Hunt launch strategy (launching next week, nervous AF)
- ✅ Anything else!

**Screenshot**: [Add architecture diagram or interesting code snippet]

**Also:** ARVO beta is open (lifetime free access). If you're a lifter, DM me—happy to onboard personally.

Ask away! I'll answer everything. 🙏
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
✅ **Authority**: 6 months building, specific tech (17 agents, <2s latency)
✅ **Vulnerable**: "Nervous AF" is relatable
✅ **Broad appeal**: Can ask about AI, fitness, OR solo founding
✅ **Visual**: Architecture diagram shows you're legit
✅ **Soft ARVO mention**: Not the focus, but available
✅ **Reciprocity**: You're giving value (answering questions) before asking

### FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
- Answer EVERY question thoroughly (even if not about ARVO)
- Share specific code examples if developers ask
- Link to dev.to article for deep technical dives
- Be genuinely helpful even to people who'll never use ARVO
- End each answer with "Any other questions?"

## 📌 THREAD #5: Launch Week - Final Call (Week 0)
**Best Timing**: 2-3 days before launch
**Goal**: Final waitlist push, mobilize supporters, prime for launch
**Expected Engagement**: 40-80 comments

### TITLE (Launching Soon Hook)
```
Launching ARVO on Product Hunt this Thursday: What I wish I knew 6 months ago
```

### BODY
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt community! 🚀

**ARVO launches THIS THURSDAY** (AI workout coach, lifetime free for beta users).

Before launch day chaos hits, wanted to share what I wish I'd known when I started 6 months ago:

**What I Thought Would Matter:**
- ❌ Perfect features
- ❌ Fancy AI architecture
- ❌ Beautiful UI

**What Actually Matters:**
- ✅ Solving ONE problem really well (set-by-set progression guidance)
- ✅ Explaining WHY (users want reasoning, not black box)
- ✅ <2s response time (anything slower = death for mid-workout app)
- ✅ Talking to users 1-on-1 (learned more in 5 user calls than 100 hours coding)

**The Scariest Part:**
Launching publicly. What if no one cares? What if it's just another "AI fitness app"?

But I built this for ME (10 years of Excel → AI coach), and 30 beta users are loving it. So... here goes nothing.

**Launching Thursday at 12:01 AM PST:**
- Real-time AI coaching (set-by-set suggestions)
- Explains reasoning behind every decision
- Lifetime free access for beta members
- Built for serious lifters who track workouts

**Screenshots**: [Add 2-3 compelling screenshots]

**If you're interested:**
1. Join the waitlist: [link]
2. Set a reminder for Thursday launch
3. Drop a comment with your biggest workout tracking frustration

**For those who've launched on PH:**
Any last-minute advice? I'm equal parts excited and terrified. 😅

See you Thursday! 💪

P.S. If you're a serious lifter, DM me—I'll personally onboard you before public launch.
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
✅ **Specific launch date**: "This Thursday" creates calendar event
✅ **Vulnerable lessons**: "What I wish I knew" is authentic
✅ **Fear sharing**: "What if no one cares?" = relatable
✅ **Multiple CTAs**: Waitlist, reminder, comment
✅ **Asks for help**: "Any advice?" generates supportive comments
✅ **Screenshots**: Multiple visuals increase engagement
✅ **Urgency**: "Before public launch" for DMs

### FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
- Respond to every piece of advice (even if you won't use it)
- Thank people publicly for support
- DM everyone who shows serious interest
- Update thread day-of: "WE'RE LIVE: [PH link]"
- Screenshot supportive comments to share on Twitter/LinkedIn

---

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES FOR ALL THREADS

### DO:
✅ **Be genuinely helpful** - Even non-ARVO users should get value
✅ **Respond fast** - Within 1-2 hours of every comment
✅ **Ask questions back** - Generate real discussions, not broadcasts
✅ **Share specifics** - Metrics, screenshots, code examples build credibility
✅ **Thank everyone** - Public appreciation goes far
✅ **Cross-promote** - Share threads on Twitter/LinkedIn for broader reach
✅ **Update threads** - Edit to add "Update: 50 signups so far!" etc.

### DON'T:
❌ **Spam** - Max 1 thread per week
❌ **Hard sell** - Lead with value, ARVO is secondary
❌ **Ignore comments** - Every comment is a potential beta user
❌ **Be vague** - "AI fitness app" = boring. "Set-by-set with <2s latency" = interesting
❌ **Fake scarcity** - Only limit beta if you genuinely can't onboard 1000 people
❌ **Copy-paste responses** - Personalize every reply

## 💡 ENGAGEMENT MULTIPLIERS

### Screenshots to Include:
1. **Workout view** with AI suggestion + reasoning (Thread #2, #3, #5)
2. **Architecture diagram** (Thread #4)
3. **Before/after** progression example (Thread #1, #3)
4. **Mobile interface** showing <2s response time (Thread #2)

### Questions That Generate Discussion:
- "What's your biggest frustration with [X]?"
- "What's the hardest part of [Y] for you?"
- "If you could change ONE thing about [Z], what would it be?"
- "What surprised you most when [building/learning/doing X]?"

### Response Templates:

**When someone shares their tracking method:**
```
Love this! [Specific thing about their method].

Question: Does [their method] handle [specific challenge]? I ran into that with Excel and had to [your solution].

If you're interested in trying ARVO, DM me—happy to onboard personally! 🙏
```

**When someone asks "what makes ARVO different?":**
```
Great question!

Most AI fitness apps generate a program once and that's it. ARVO adapts set-by-set:

1. You log a set (100kg x 8 reps, 3 RIR)
2. AI suggests next set (105kg x 10 reps)
3. Explains WHY ("You left 3 RIR, target is 1—increase weight")

Real-time adaptation + reasoning transparency = different from generic AI.

Want to see it in action? I can DM you early access!
```

**When someone is skeptical about AI:**
```
Totally get the skepticism—lots of GPT wrappers out there.

What makes ARVO different:
- Parametric knowledge engine (362 lines of methodology rules, not just prompts)
- <2s response time (critical for mid-workout)
- Explains reasoning (no black box)
- Built by someone who lifts (me, 10+ years)

I was skeptical of AI fitness apps too! That's why I built this.

Happy to chat more if you're curious—DM me!
