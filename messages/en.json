        "customEquipment": {
          "question": "Can I add my own custom equipment?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Got a specialty machine your gym has? Custom cable attachment? Add it once with a name and example exercises. The AI will suggest exercises for your custom equipment in future workouts. It's in the equipment database permanently."
        },
        "injury": {
          "question": "What if I get injured or have pain?",
          "answer": "The Insights system automatically detects patterns. Log pain once on French Press? It notes it. Twice? Creates an insight with severity level. Three times? Automatically avoids that exercise and suggests alternatives. Every AI agent reads active insights and adapts decisions accordingly. Zero configuration required."
        },
        "learning": {
          "question": "How does the AI learn my preferences?",
          "answer": "Three ways: 1) Pattern detection (you substitute Exercise A with B 3+ times → learns preference), 2) Notes extraction (write 'loved this exercise' at end of workout → creates positive memory with NLP), 3) Behavioral signals (consistently high mental readiness on certain movements → confidence boost). All automatic, zero manual tagging. Just write honest feedback and the Pattern Scout agent extracts insights."
        },
        "vsExcel": {
          "question": "How is this different from an Excel spreadsheet?",
          "answer": "Excel gives you control but zero intelligence. You manually calculate next weight, track volume, decide when to deload. Arvo automates all of it with AI reasoning: set-by-set progression suggestions in <500ms, volume tracking vs MEV/MAV/MRV, automatic deload triggers, biomechanical weight adjustments for exercise swaps, pattern learning from your preferences. Excel is static. Arvo adapts."
        },
        "dataOwnership": {
          "question": "Is my training data mine? Can I export it?",
          "answer": "100% yours. Export anytime to JSON/CSV. Privacy-first design: no data selling, no third-party analytics tracking your workouts. Your training history belongs to you. Supabase backend with row-level security. You own your data completely."
        },
        "pricing": {
          "question": "How much does it cost?",
          "answer": "Free to start. Passwordless magic link authentication, no credit card required. Core features (AI workout generation, progression tracking, insights, custom equipment) are available immediately. The goal is to make intelligent training accessible, not to gatekeep behind paywalls."
        },
        "contestPrep": {
          "question": "Can I use this for contest prep?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Track volume vs MRV week by week, monitor mental readiness trends across your prep, get automatic deload suggestions when fatigue accumulates. Everything you need for structured contest preparation with intelligent volume management."
        },
        "periodization": {
          "question": "Does it understand periodization?",
          "answer": "Yes. Kuba Method has accumulation/intensification/deload phases built in. Mentzer HIT has 4-7 day recovery protocols. The system tracks where you are in your training cycle and adjusts volume, intensity, and frequency accordingly. It's not just logging—it's intelligent periodization."
        },
        "customPrograms": {
          "question": "What if I want to run my own program?",
          "answer": "You're not locked into Kuba or Mentzer. Track any program you want. The AI still provides set-by-set progression guidance, injury pattern detection, volume tracking, and biomechanical adjustments. Use the intelligence layer with your own programming."
